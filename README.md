# Weather_Prediction
Overview
The weather prediction model utilizes a dataset containing weather-related features such as precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, wind speed, and weather type. These features are used to train a machine learning model to predict the weather condition.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of 1281 entries, each containing the following columns:

precipitation: Precipitation level (in millimeters)
temp_max: Maximum temperature (in Celsius)
temp_min: Minimum temperature (in Celsius)
wind: Wind speed (in meters per second)
weather: Weather type (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy)
The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to handle missing values and ensure consistency in data types.

Model
The weather prediction model is built using machine learning algorithms, particularly classification techniques, to predict the weather condition based on the input features. The model is trained on the historical data with known weather conditions.

After training, the model is capable of predicting the weather type given new input data containing features similar to those in the training dataset.
